Prepare yourself for entering the most terrifying maze, where lights don't go very far as the darkness is so dense that you almost have to push yourself ahead.
Be aware! Don't go too fast or you might find out why nobody ever came out of this maze alive...

## About the game

The evolution of Dark Cave, but now with graphics! This game was made with the pourpose of learning more about game development and other game engines in general.
It was all written in GDScript, the original idea was to write it all in C++, but as I researched a little more I realised that it would not make sense, that would endup takong too long and defeating the whole purpose of the project, which is to learn more about game development and where it can better fit with the game engines but also learn the whole concept of creating games in general.
The idea now is to develop it all with Godot and use the best features and tools it has to offer and then port what I can and what makes sense to C++.
This repository contains all the necessary files required to run the game on your local machine.
